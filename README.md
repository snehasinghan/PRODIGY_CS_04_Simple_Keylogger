# 🔐 Task 04 - Simple Keylogger  
## Prodigy InfoTech Cyber Security Internship  

---

## 📌 Task Objective  
Create a basic keylogger program that records and logs keystrokes.  
Focus on logging the keys pressed and saving them to a file.

---

## 💻 Project Description  
This project is developed as part of **Task 04** during my Cyber Security Internship at Prodigy InfoTech.  

The program captures keyboard inputs using Python and stores the pressed keys in a text file named `keylog.txt`.  

The program keeps running and logging keys until the **ESC key** is pressed.

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used  
- Python  
- pynput library  

---

## 🚀 Features  
- Records keyboard keystrokes  
- Saves keys into a file (`keylog.txt`)  
- Stops automatically when ESC key is pressed  
- Simple and beginner-friendly implementation  

---

## ▶️ How to Run  

1️. Install required library: 
pip install pynput

2. Run the program:
   python keylogger.py

3. Open keylog.txt to view logged keystrokes.

Project Files:
